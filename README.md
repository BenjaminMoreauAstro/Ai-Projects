# Ai-Projects-2022
A collection of Ai projects from Computational Physics/Machine Learning club

For Gradient_Descent_Wine_Tasting.ipynb, this was a project done as part of the computational physics class/machine learning club at university of Kansas.
To get the file to run, it should be easy in Google Colab, but some small edits might be needed to do it in YOUR google drive instead of mine.
Also, running the file in Jupyter or something should be easy as well, only a file path would need to be changed.
Research paper for wine_tasting from Phy 815: https://www.overleaf.com/project/602d9e3a224ff86e4e13c5
