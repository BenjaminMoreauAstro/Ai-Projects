# Ai-Projects-2022
A collection of Ai projects from Computational Physics and the Machine Learning Club.

Gradient_Descent_Wine_Tasting.ipynb--a project done as part of the computational physics class at the University of Kansas.

To run, use Google Colab and (possibly) make small edits in CELL 2, changing it to work in your own, personal Google drive.  
Running the file in Jupyter works as well, simply ignore CELLS 1 & 2 and ensure you have the required packages installed, found in CELL 3
